  <h1>WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU WITNESS ANIMAL CRUELTY</h1>
  <OL>
    <li>
      <H3>Remain calm and get veterinary care.</H3>
    
    Please don’t assume that someone else will help. An abused animal may need immediately veterinary care, without which, he or she may suffer for a long time or die from his or her injuries. If you must leave the animal momentarily, ask someone you trust to stay with him or her while you’re gone and return as soon as possible with help. Check out our guidance on what to do if you spot an animal in distress.

      <h3>Document the crime</h3>
      The second you see that something is wrong, take a photo or video with your cell phone to document the details if you can, and be sure to capture important information such as license plate numbers and a visual of the abuser. Collect witnesses if you can, and get statements from experts, such as veterinarians, about the animal’s physical condition or cause of death

<h3>File a first information report (FIR) with the police immediately</h3>

Report the crime to the police. A FIR sets the process of criminal justice into motion – police will investigate a case only after a FIR has been filed. If you don’t know how to file a FIR, this guide will help.  The police are required to take your FIR. If in spite of this, your FIR isn’t registered, take the matter up with the Superintendent of Police or other higher-level officers, such as the Deputy Inspector General of Police or the Inspector General of Police. You can also file a private complaint with the court.

      <h3>Notify other appropriate authorities</h3>

      In addition to law-enforcement officials, think about other authorities you could file a complaint with. For example, if you witness cruelty to animals at a tourist site, notify the Minister of Tourism of the state you’re in. If someone is abusive to wildlife, contact a forest officer via your state’s forest department, or if the abuse occurred on a college campus, get in touch with the dean. Contact details of such officials can usually be found easily on the Internet.
